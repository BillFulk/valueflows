##Background
The [Care and Share Time Bank (CSTB)](https://www.hourworld.org/bank/?hw=1057) in Columbus, Ohio, USA utilizes the [Time and Talents](http://hourworld.org/_TimeAndTalents.htm) timebanking platform offered by [hOurworld](http://hourworld.org/index.htm) for all time exchanges between its members.

CSTB formed in 2010 and currently has 276 members.  Currently, CSTB is NOT registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a charitable, tax-exempt organization.  Instead, CSTB is sponsored as non-profit organization without religious affiliation by the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Columbus, Ohio which does have a 501(c)(3) status granted by the IRS.  CSTB members envision acquiring an independent tax-exempt status separate from the church, but that process has not started.

CSTB exchanges are between members for 1) _personal_; 2) _administrative_; and, 3) _business_ services across a wide range of categories

###Personal Service Exchanges


###Administrative Service Exchanges


###Business Service Exchanges

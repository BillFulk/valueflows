##Background
The [Care and Share Time Bank (CSTB)](https://www.hourworld.org/bank/?hw=1057) in Columbus, Ohio, USA utilizes the [Time and Talents (TnT)](http://hourworld.org/_TimeAndTalents.htm) timebanking platform offered by [hOurworld](http://hourworld.org/index.htm) for all time exchanges between its members.

CSTB formed in 2010 and currently has 276 members.  Currently, CSTB is NOT registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a charitable, tax-exempt organization.  Instead, CSTB is sponsored as non-profit organization without religious affiliation by the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Columbus, Ohio which does have a 501(c)(3) status granted by the IRS.  CSTB members envision acquiring an independent tax-exempt status separate from the church, but that process has not started.

CSTB exchanges are between members for 1) _personal_; 2) _administrative_; and, 3) _business_ services across a wide range of [categories](https://github.com/stevebosserman/valueflows/blob/master/use-cases/CSTB%20Service%20Categories%20and%20Services-09Apr2016.pdf).  

Regardless of the type of service, all exchanges result from the match between an **_offer_** made by a member who has capacity and capability to deliver a service and a **_request_** made by a member who needs a particular service.  An exchange is considered successfully completed when the request is fulfilled to the satisfaction of the one making the request and the agreed-to time allocation for delivering on it has been credited to the one making the offer. 

Each timebank member has an individual account on the TnT platform which tracks the hours credited for having fulfilled requests and hours debited in exchange for having requests fulfilled.  

In addition to tracking exchanges and account balances, the TnT platform, which is accessible through a browser or as [smart phone app](https://hourworld.org/_MobileAPI.htm) for Android or iOS, displays member profiles and contact information (information in fields may be public or private at the discretion of each member) as well as offers and requests posted by members.

Each exchange has three steps:

1. Arrangement for the exchange: when, where, who will provide what (for instance, if materials or tools need to be acquired / procured to do the work, agreement will be made on payment of money, not time credits, for them).
2. Execution of the exchange: whatever was requested is completed per the terms of the arrangement agreed-to in the previous step.
3. Transfer of credit to the account of the one delivering the requested service with any comments, compliments, or complaints about the delivery.

Regardless of the exchange, an hour any member spends delivering a service has the same value as an hour spent by any other member delivering any type of service.  The constant value for time regardless of service delivered or who delivers it plus the notion that timebank hours cannot be used as a currency to make market purchases or settle debts are key in IRS rulings exempting timebank exchanges from tax liabilities.  Members of the Dane County TimeBank (DCTB) in Wisconsin have compiled an excellent [FAQ page](http://danecountytimebank.org/faq) on their website which addresses these questions about the IRS rulings.  

Of note, the DCTB utilizes a different exchange platform than CSTB called [Community Weaver](http://timebanks.org/get-started/community-weaver/) offered by [TimeBanks USA](http://timebanks.org/).  I suggest reading the [history of TimeBanks USA](http://timebanks.org/about/), a concept developed by [Dr. Edgar S. Cahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_S._Cahn) in the 1980s and 90s.  Compare his vision of timebanks, which is not necessarily associated with a particular organizational form, with the experiences of Linda Hogan and Terry Daniels from hOurworld who, as the title of this article suggests [Community Cooperatives: Fusing Cooperatives and Time Banks to Meet Community Needs](http://www.geo.coop/story/community-cooperatives), see a historically significant and practical connection between timebanks and cooperatives.

But I digress...

Despite similarities among personal, administrative, and business services, their distinctions result in somewhat unique use-cases for each which will be outlined below:

###Personal Service Exchanges


###Administrative Service Exchanges


###Business Service Exchanges

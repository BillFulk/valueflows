#Less-than-truckload shipping (LTL)

Excerpted from this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_than_truckload_shipping).

> Less than truckload shipping (LTL) is the transportation of relatively small freight. 
The alternatives to LTL carriers are parcel carriers or full truckload carriers. 
Parcel carriers usually handle small packages and freight that can be broken down into units 
less than 150 pounds (68 kg).

> LTL shipments typically weigh between 151 and 20,000 lb (68 and 9,072 kg). 
Less than Truckload carriers use "hub and spoke" operations where small local terminals are the spokes 
('end of line') and larger more central terminals are the hubs (also called Distribution Centers or DC's). 
Spoke terminals collect local freight from various shippers and consolidate that freight onto enclosed 
trailers for transporting to the delivering or hub terminal where the freight will be further sorted and 
consolidated for additional transporting (also known as linehauling). 
In most cases, the end of line terminals employ local drivers who start the day by loading up their trailers 
and heading out to make deliveries first. Then when the trailer is empty they begin making pickups and 
return to the terminal for sorting and delivery next day. Because of the efficiency of this order of operations 
most deliveries are performed in the morning and pickups are made in the afternoon.

This is another example where the transportation process is very different from the transfer of ownership. 
And where the agents involved in the transfer of ownership (e.g. the buyer and the seller) usually know nothing 
about the actual logistics involved.

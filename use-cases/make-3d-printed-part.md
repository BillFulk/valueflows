### Make 3D printed part

(based on Sensorica cases but simplified)

1. Daniel makes a design for a 3d printed part and uploads it so others can access it.

2. Jim makes a printed part using Daniel's design.

* He also uses a 3d printer that lives in the lab.
* He also consumes some 3d printing filament already in the lab.
* After some effort, he creates a 3d printed part.

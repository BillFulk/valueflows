#[Sensorica 3D Printer](http://nrp.sensorica.co/accounting/exchange/466/)

* Purchased from ORD Solutions in Waterloo, Ontario
* Tried to get a relative of a friend to bring it to Montreal, but he couldn't do it.
* Requested shipping from ORD Solutions.
* ORD Solutions arranged transportation with another company.
* ORD Solutions invoiced Sensorica for shipping, but the actual transportation process 
was conducted by this other company who was not named in the invoice.

This is a fairly typical scenario, in that three agents are involved: 

1. the agent who provided the goods
2. the agent who received the goods
3. the agent who provided the transportation service

Except that often the agent who does the actual shipping is named, 
and the package can be tracked, as in 
[shipping-1](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/blob/master/use-cases/shipping-1.md).

But regardless, many (or in this case all) of the details of the shipping process 
happen in the context of the shipping agent. Some details may be published and thus 
known to the other agents in the exchange, but mostly they don't know and they 
don't care.
